# AwlsomeLinux

Creating a Linux Distributon Seemed to be an impossible task, where only the huge people like Debian or Fedora could make them, or the best you can do is remix Ubuntu and hope it contents that urge of making something. However, thanks to Ivandavidov's Minimal Linux Live Project (https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal) that dream is a reality for me.

## What is AwlsomeLinux?

* The Latest Long-Term-Support Linux Kernel (4.4.x)

* The Latest Glibc (2.24)
