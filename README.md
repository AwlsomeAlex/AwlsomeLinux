# AwlsomeLinux (Fork of Minimal Linux Live)

Creating a Linux Distributon Seemed to be an impossible task, where only the huge people like Debian or Fedora could make them, or the best you can do is remix Ubuntu and hope it contents that urge of making something. However, thanks to Ivandavidov's Minimal Linux Live Project (https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal) that dream is a reality for me.

## NEWS: **A "short" break.**
After the week of rewritting I just had, I will be taking a very short break away from AwlsomeLinux, so don't expect much to happen, but as soon as I return, the Overlay Generation Script will be completed. Due to no Crew in November, I hope to work on the AMPM "Another Minimal Package Manager" project and get some packages implemented, along with having a usable GUI for AwlsomeLinux with the help of either 'xvesa' and 'fltk' or 'xorg' and 'xfreedesktop'. 

## What is AwlsomeLinux?
Right now, AwlsomeLinux is a minimal, almost installable, and text-based Linux Environment (Wouldn't call it a Distro yet...) which has the following features:
* The Latest Long-Term-Support Linux Kernel (4.4.x)
* The Latest Stable BusyBox (1.25.x Stable)
* The Latest Glibc (2.24)

**Extra Packages Such As:**
* Links 2.13 (Text-Based Web Browser)
* Dropbear 2016.74 (Shell SSH)
* Nano 2.6.3 (Alternative Text Editor)
