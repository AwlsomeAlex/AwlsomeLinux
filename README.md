# AwlsomeLinux (Old Repository)

Welcome to the Old Repository of AwlsomeLinux. This repository is full of scripts which can be compared to Ivandavidov's Minimal Linux Live, so this might be a good reference if you'd like to simplify his work, otherwise this will just collect dust, for there is no more use for it. :(
