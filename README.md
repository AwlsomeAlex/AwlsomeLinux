# AwlsomeLinux (Fork of Minimal Linux Live)

Creating a Linux Distributon Seemed to be an impossible task, where only the huge people like Debian or Fedora could make them, or the best you can do is remix Ubuntu and hope it contents that urge of making something. However, thanks to Ivandavidov's Minimal Linux Live Project (https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal) that dream is a reality for me.

## NEWS: **A Rewrite is needed...**
Well as quickly as I created AwlsomeLinux, I didn't expect it to be this disorganized and cluddered, so I've decided to rewite AwlsomeLinux **COMPLETELY**, hoping to break away from any ties drawing me towards Minimal Linux Live as well, not due to it being a bad thing or anything, but it's just too complicated for what I want, so instead of simplifying the process, i'm remaking it. This is how it will be designed:
* A Core Directory & Build Script (Makes Linux Kernel, Busybox and Glibc)
* An Image Directory & Build Script (Gets Syslinux and Makes ISO Image)
* An Overlay Directory & Buidl Script **[TBD]** (*Possible Idea:* Gets Overlay Scripts from seperate repository and compiles them.)

## What is AwlsomeLinux?
Right now, AwlsomeLinux is a minimal, almost installable, and text-based Linux Environment (Wouldn't call it a Distro yet...) which has the following features:
* The Latest Long-Term-Support Linux Kernel (4.4.x)
* The Latest Stable BusyBox (1.25.x Stable)
* The Latest Glibc (2.24)

**Extra Packages Such As:**
* Links 2.13 (Text-Based Web Browser)
* Dropbear 2016.74 (Shell SSH)
* Nano 2.6.3 (Alternative Text Editor)
