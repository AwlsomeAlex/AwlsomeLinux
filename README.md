# AwlsomeLinux

Creating a Linux Distributon Seemed to be an impossible task, where only the huge people like Debian or Fedora could make them, or the best you can do is remix Ubuntu and hope it contents that urge of making something. However, thanks to Ivandavidov's Minimal Linux Live Project (https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal) that dream is a reality for me.

## NEWS: **AN INSTALL METHOD?!?**
After playing around a bit, I have discovered a way to Install AwlsomeLinux onto the Hard Drive, and for it to retain all user information in the OverlayFS, now if you were to flash this on a thumb drive, it would work the same way, however with the ability to install AwlsomeLinux, its getting a little bit closer to becoming a full Linux Distribution! Now the process will **HAVE** to be dependent on a host system (ArchLinux Live CD) until AwlsomeLinux gets the **mkfs.ext4** tools and **cfdisk** along with **Dialog** and forth. I will be writing this script tonight and hopefully have it released tomorrow. 

## What is AwlsomeLinux?
AwlsomeLinux right now is an idea, but by simplifing and replicating the process which Ivandavidov created for his project, I can use the series of scripts to create a system which I want, and eventually can become Self-Hosted. Once self-hosted, AwlsomeLinux can succeed. All that will be included at first will be the Linux Kernel, simple Glibc Libraries, Busybox, and Syslinux. Thats about it at that point. However thanks to the LFS Project being a huge reference point, by creating Overlay scripts, I can add features such as Nano Support (My Main Goal due to Ncurses not working), make it actually installable, and maybe even eventually add Xorg and add a simple GUI Interface. However this will all be impossible without the understandings of the Linux System at its finest, so AwlsomeLinux will take time to grow, but it will eventually. Eventually, I want to branch away the Ivandavidov's Commit Chart where I'm dependent on him, to where AwlsomeLinux will get to the point of being on Distrowatch, but that's a far away dream.
