# AwlsomeLinux (Fork of Minimal Linux Live)

Creating a Linux Distributon Seemed to be an impossible task, where only the huge people like Debian or Fedora could make them, or the best you can do is remix Ubuntu and hope it contents that urge of making something. However, thanks to Ivandavidov's Minimal Linux Live Project (https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal) that dream is a reality for me.

## NEWS: **AN INSTALL METHOD?!?**
Wow, this is quite surprising... just as I was getting ready to start the Installer, Ivandavidov had an unexpected package added to his project, mll-tools (Minimal Linux Live Tools) which included the mkfs.ext2 command, a simple partition editor, and a complete **INSTALLER!** I will now make plans to instead implement mll-tools into AwlsomeLinux, because instead of doing it on an ArchLinux Live CD, it can now be directly installed **ON A MINIMAL LINUX LIVE CD!** Afterwards I will start to make plans on reorganizing the Overlay Structure, maybe into something like a **Package Manager** where the applications are loaded to a /usr/package/(source), I'm not sure, but whats next is the Installer, and what is after will most likely be Dialog.

## What is AwlsomeLinux?
Right now, AwlsomeLinux is a minimal, almost installable, and text-based Linux Environment (Wouldn't call it a Distro yet...) which has the following features:
* The Latest Long-Term-Support Linux Kernel (4.4.x)
* The Latest Stable BusyBox (1.25.x Stable)
* The Latest Glibc (2.24)

**Extra Packages Such As:**
* Links 2.13 (Text-Based Web Browser)
* Dropbear 2016.74 (Shell SSH)
* Nano 2.6.3 (Alternative Text Editor)
* MLL-Tools {Minimal Linux Live Tools} (Installer for Minimal-Like Projects)
