# AwlsomeLinux (Discontiued)
 
## 2/28/17: What's going on?
As time goes on, I've realized how cluttered AwlsomeLinux got, with its constant rewrites and improvements, so I decided to move on and start another project, [StarLinux](https://github.com/AwlsomeAlex/StarLinux). Basically what it is an improved compiling process with full automation, along with it slowly leading to the point of a fully equiped Linux Distribution. Progress will be slow as time grows short, but this will be the LAST commit for AwlsomeLinux, along with the locking of the MasterBranch and the removal of all others. I hope to see you check out StarLinux, as it will be MUCH better than AwlsomeLinux ever was.
